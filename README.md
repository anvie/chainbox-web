# Chainbox

Simplified Web3 Generator. Let you build Web3 project in matter of seconds, from creating smart contract, deploying into blockchain,
and integrate with the web frontend!

## Getting Started

Run backend services:

1. Ganache, use ./etc/script/run-ganache.sh
2. Run Mongodb
2. Run chainbox-backend
3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
